##### Anvitha Chaluvadi, Maria Notarianni, Owura Fosuhene Akosah

## Background

Welcome to the world of programming with Pandas. It's time to put away the Excel sheet and join the big leagues. 

## What You’re Creating

You need to create a tool  that analyzes and visualizes expenses made last year and determine which month, category of transactions he spent more and to track his expenses and to know if he spent right the whole year.Once you understand how you spent your money last year, you will be better equipped to set goals for the future.

## Before You Begin

Create a new GitHub repo called personal_finance_management_tool. Then, clone it to your computer.
In your local Git repository, create a directory for the Python activities. Name the folder finance_tool.ipynb
 Remember to use JupyterLab to correctly generate the .ipynb file format. 
Push these changes to the repository that you created in Step 1.

## Instructions
The instructions for this assignment are divided into three parts:
* Prepare the Data
* Perform Quantitative Analysis

## Prepare the Data

First, you will read in and clean CSV file for analysis. The CSV file contain data on numerous expenses for last year. Use the personal-transaction data to complete the following steps:
Use Pandas to read the CSV file into DataFrames. Be sure to convert the date to a DateTimeIndex.
Convert the data types as needed.
Drop extra column ‘description’.
Change category column to unassigned 

## Perform Quantitative Analysis
Analyze the data to determine what month or category he spent more and to know if he spent right the whole year. Specifically, you will do a analysis by calculating the total amount spent for each category and month.
