## Background
Streamlining the budgeting process through automation allows users to swiftly identify their spending patterns, optimize income, and gauge their financial well-being in comparison to the national average.


## What We’re Creating

We are creating a tool that analyzes and visualizes expenses made last year and determines which month, category of transactions he spent more and to track his expenses and to know if he spent right the whole year. Once the user understands how they spent their money last year, they will be better equipped to set goals for the future.


## Instructions
The instructions for this assignment are divided into three parts:
* Prepare the Data
* Perform Quantitative Analysis

## Prepare the Data

First, you will read in and clean CSV file for analysis. The CSV file contain data on numerous expenses for last year. Use the personal-transaction data to complete the following steps:
Use Pandas to read the CSV file into DataFrames. Be sure to convert the date to a DateTimeIndex.
Convert the data types as needed.
Drop extra column ‘description’.
Change category column to unassigned 

## Perform Quantitative Analysis
Analyze the data to determine what month or category he spent more and to know if he spent right the whole year. Specifically, you will do a analysis by calculating the total amount spent for each category and month.
